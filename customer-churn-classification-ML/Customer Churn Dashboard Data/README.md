## Overview

This dashboard translates the machine-learning churn predictions into an interactive, business-friendly view for decision-makers. Each customer is scored using a trained classification model, and the results are aggregated to highlight churn risk patterns and priority segments.


## Key Metrics

### Total Customers
Total number of customers scored by the model.

### High Risk Customers
Customers predicted to have a high probability of churn.

### Average Customer Churn Probability
Mean predicted churn probability across all customers.

### Percentage of High Risk Customers
Proportion of customers classified as high churn risk.


## Visual Insights

### Churn Risk by Contract Type
Shows how predicted churn risk varies across contract durations.

### Customer Distribution by Risk Level
Breakdown of customers into low, medium, and high risk segments.

### Churn Risk by Internet Service Type
Highlights differences in churn behavior based on service usage.

### High-Risk Customer Table
Lists individual customers with the highest churn probability, along with tenure, charges, contract type, and payment method. This table is designed for operational use by retention teams.


## Interactivity

### Contract Filter
Allows users to dynamically filter all visuals and metrics by contract type.

All metrics and charts update in real time based on selected filters.


## Business Use Case

This dashboard can be used by:

Retention and customer success teams to identify high-risk customers

Management to understand churn drivers at a segment level

Marketing teams to design targeted retention campaigns

The focus is on interpretability and actionability rather than model internals, making the output suitable for non-technical stakeholders.
